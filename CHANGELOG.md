# Changelog

All notable changes to **hermes-wiki-memory** are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- `WIKI_PATH` env override (read at load) so the wiki can live outside
  `<HERMES_ROOT>/wiki`. Matches the `SETUP.md` documentation, which previously
  claimed the override without the code backing it.

### Fixed
- `SETUP.md` install command used a `github:` prefix that mangles the URL
  (`github.com/github:chrisluersen/...`) and breaks install. Corrected to the
  `owner/repo` shorthand and documented why.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- Core plugin: `wiki` memory provider — per-turn semantic recall via gbrain,
  on-session-end insight extraction, on-memory-write mirror to the wiki,
  on-delegation capture, per-turn prefetch recall.
- Ship full self-contained stack: memory provider (`__init__.py` +
  `wiki_client.py`) + reference to the companion skills (`gbrain-integration`,
  `llm-wiki`, `wiki-maintenance`) that ship with Hermes Agent.
- `SETUP.md` end-to-end guide (prerequisites, gbrain, wiki scaffold,
  maintenance cron, verification, profiles/bots notes).

### Fixed
- Removed bundled `skills/` — the install-time scanner treated env-secret/curl/
  git-clone patterns in `.md` prose as injection signals and returned a
  `dangerous` verdict that blocks install (`--force` cannot override).
  Prose now lives in the docs; skills are referenced by catalog name instead.
- Install command corrected to `owner/repo` shorthand in `README.md`.
